Q.1 What is the difference between a Python tuple and Python list?
---Lists are mutable and tuples are not mutable
Q.2 Which of the following methods work both in Python lists and Python tuples?
---index()
Q.3 What will end up in the variable y after this code is executed? x , y = 3, 4
--->4
Q.4 In the following Python code, what will end up in the variable y? x = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'fred' : 42, 'jan': 100}; y = x.items()
--- A list of tuples
Q.5 Which of the following tuples is greater than x in the following Python sequence? x = (5, 1, 3); if ??? > x : ...
--->(6, 0, 0)
Q.6 What does the following Python code accomplish, assuming the c is a non-empty dictionary? tmp = list(); for k, v in c.items(): tmp.append( (v, k))
--- It creates a list of tuples where each tuple is a value, key pair
Q.7 If the variable data is a Python list, how do we sort it in reverse order?
---data.sort(reverse=True)
Q.8 Using the following tuple, how would you print 'Wed'? days = ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun')
---print days[2]
Q.9 In the following Python loop, why are there two iteration variables (k and v)? c = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}; for k, v in c.items() : ...
---Because the items() method in dictionaries returns a list of tuples
Q.10 Given that Python lists and Python tuples are quite similar - when might you prefer to use a tuple over a list?
---For a temporary variable that you will use and discard without modifying
